    <h3> Project Description </h3>
    <p> 
      Our project is an online workout log. The user will be able to log into our website and store all of his or hers reps and sets for each exercise. The content will be user generated and stored in a MySQL database. Upon login, the user will be able to add exercises then be able to add those exercises to user created routines and predefined muscle groups. </p>

      <p>
      Once the user has added all exercises, one can click on the exercise to bring up options specific for that exercise. The user will be able to add new reps and sets, view past workouts, or view a graph of previous lifts. 
        </p>
